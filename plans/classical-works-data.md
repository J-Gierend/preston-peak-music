## PROGRAM NOTES (Verified from Website)

### Sonata No. 1 "Nightfall"
> This work is dedicated to the sounds of the romantic era, embracing the expressive, dramatic, and story-telling natures of this period. The opening passage foreshadows a powerful crescendo of passion and anger, and the piece's dark and frustrated tone ultimately depicts how an individual's tumultuous emotions may swell, burst, and hurt themselves and those around them.

### Marriage Suite
> Three bridal processionals for string quartet. In the spring of 2025, I got married, and I composed the bridal processional that my wife walked down the aisle to. I wrote my wife three bridal processionals to choose from: Hailey's Walk, Something Blue (a romantic conversation between the strings), and Serenade for Spring (inspired by Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings).

### Songs for Winter
> As the 2023 holidays approached, I composed this short collection of piano pieces dedicated to the season of winter. The work was composed with a variety of compositional styles ranging from minimalist-ambient, to contemporary neo-classical, to traditional classical. Works from Kensuke Ushio, Toby Fox, Ludovico Einaudi, and Frédéric Chopin were a few of my compositional influences.

### Like the Stars Forever and Ever
> The book of Daniel in the Old Testament of the Bible contains themes of hope and faith during times of great struggle. This is what inspired this piece - specifically Chapter 12. In this piece, I play with dissonance in a way I never have before. I explore creating tension through the use of timbre, tonal harmonies, and microtonal harmonies. Eventually the mood flips from dark, somber, and epic to light and playful. Scored for 1(pic).1(b.cl).0.0 - 0.1.1.0 - perc(2) - pf - str(2.1.1.1). Daniel 12:3 - Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.

### Miniatures for Piano
> A collection of 19 short piano pieces carefully composed in a neo-classical and minimal style with emphasis on depicting the object of the miniature titles. Each composition maintains an abstract quality while being interconnected throughout the album. Includes pieces such as Sunset, Midnight, Sunrise, the 'Lost in...' series (Space, Time, Translation, Love, Thought), a coffee-themed suite (Hot, Cold, Instant, No More Left), and four interludes.

### Overcast Skies
> Melancholy and hopeful, an overcast sky will either be followed by rain or sunshine breaking through the clouds. This was the imagery in mind when composing this piece in a modern, neoclassical style. A melodic shift growing into a swelling climax drives forth the idea of rain or sunshine bursting through the clouds, leaving the listener to interpret the outcome.

### Solitude Waltz
> This waltz is nicknamed 'Solitude', and this piece reflects this feeling. Not 'Loneliness', because being alone isn't always bad - but solitude, which can be a period of growth or reflection.

### Pushing Onward
> Pushing Onward is a neoclassical piece which drew inspiration from modern, neoclassical composers to create a growing, epic, and emotional piece that is a joy to perform.

### Less Than Three
> A short, heartfelt waltz written with my wife in mind.

### Lost in Space and Time
> This set is made up of two pieces, Lost in Space and Lost in Time. The first creates an ethereal mood using unique chords which arpeggiate behind a singing, melancholy, and slightly varying melody. The second uses a 6/4 time signature at a remarkably slow tempo to make this fairly common time signature sound a bit odd with large spaces of sustained piano.
