The opening passage foreshadows a powerful crescendo of passion and anger, and the piece's dark and frustrated tone ultimately depicts how an individual's tumultuous emotions may swell, burst, and hurt themselves and those around them.",

This is what inspired this piece - specifically Chapter 12. In this piece, I play with dissonance in a way I never have before. I explore creating tension through the use of timbre, tonal harmonies, and microtonal harmonies. Eventually the mood flips from dark, somber, and epic to light and playful. Scored for 1(pic).1(b.cl).0.0 - 0.1.1.0 - perc(2) - pf - str(2.1.1.1).
